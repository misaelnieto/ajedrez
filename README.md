> **Yet another naive implementation of a chess game engine**

This is a simple implementation of a chess game engine. I started it to learn Rust with the assistance of ChatGPT. Over time, I realized that some of the recommendations provided by ChatGPT were likely inspired by https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js.git, as certain implementations seemed quite familiar to me later.
